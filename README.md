# Time-Series-Signal-Processing
Applying Unsupervised Learning to identify each drilling sequence from complex time series signals. Improve the identification accuracy from around 60% to 99%. 
- Red curve: HookLoadTraBlock; 
- Blue line: Top Drive Close = 1 (In drilling process); Top Drive Close = 0 (Not in drilling process);
