# Time-Series-Signal-Processing
Utilize Unsupervised Learning and cutting-edge Signal Processing to identify each drilling sequence from complex time series signals, based on hook load block value. Improve the identification accuracy from around 60% to 99%. 
Those pictures show the visualization result, after applying my innovative algorithm:
- Red curve (input): HookLoadTraBlock; 
- Blue line (result): Top Drive Close = 1 (In drilling process); Top Drive Close = 0 (Not in drilling process);
